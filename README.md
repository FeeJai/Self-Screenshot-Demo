## Browser Requirements

- Chrome 72+
- Firefox 66+

The app uses the Screen Capture API (`getDisplayMedia`) which requires HTTPS in production or localhost for development.

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML page with styling and structure
- `screenshot.js` - JavaScript implementation using Screen Capture API

## Technical Details

This implementation follows the methodology of modern screenshot libraries by:

1. **Pre-initializing Media**: Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` to start screen capture first
2. **Real-time Capture**: Draws video frames to canvas for immediate screenshot capture
3. **Optimized Settings**: Configures video stream for optimal quality (1920x1080, 30-60fps)
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for different browser scenarios
5. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of media streams and blob URLs

## Security Notes

- Screen Capture API requires user permission
- Only works on HTTPS or localhost
- No data is sent to external servers - everything runs locally
